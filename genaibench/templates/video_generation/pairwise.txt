4. Whether the generated video is consistent and coherent in terms of the scene, objects, and characters.
5. Whether the generated video is dynamic and not static like a single image.
6. Whether the generated video is visually appealing and esthetically pleasing.

After providing your explanation, you must output only one of the following choices as your final verdict with a label:

1. Model A is better: [[A>B]]
2. Model B is better: [[B>A]]
3. Tie, relatively the same acceptable quality: [[A=B=Good]]
4. Both are bad: [[A=B=Bad]]
