There are no visible artifacts such as distortion, watermarks, or unusual elements that would detract from the image's quality.\n\nIn contrast, Model B's image, while visually appealing, does not quite match the text prompt as effectively, as the bunny is sitting on the floor rather than in the toilet bowl.
