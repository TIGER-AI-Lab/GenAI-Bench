Both models seem to have successfully captured the essence of the text prompt with buildings on fire and an old film still aesthetic. The sense of distance, shadow, and lighting is consistent in both models. The visual quality is clear, with good resolution, brightness, and color. The scenes are dynamic and not static like a single image, and both are visually appealing and esthetically pleasing.\n\nTherefore, the final verdict would be:\n[[A=B=Good]]", "model_vote": "[[A=B=Good]]", "human_vote": "rightvote", "correct": false}

There is no significant deviation from the text prompt in either model, and both maintain a sense of distance, shadow, and lighting that appears natural. The visual quality is clear, with good resolution, brightness, and color. The scenes, objects, and characters are consistent and coherent in both models.

{"idx": 5, "prompt": "a skateboard on the top of a surfboard, front view", "response": "To evaluate the quality of the responses provided by the two AI video generation models, we need to assess each model's adherence to the text prompt and the overall quality of the generated videos. Model A and Model B both appear to have successfully placed a skateboard on the top of a surfboard in a front view, as per the text prompt.\n\nModel A's generated video seems to have a more natural look in terms of the sense of distance, shadow, and lighting. The skateboard and surfboard are clearly visible, and the colors are vibrant and true to life. The video is dynamic and not static like a single image, which is an important aspect of video quality.\n\nModel B's generated video, on the other hand, has a slightly less natural look, with the shadows and lighting appearing less realistic. The skateboard and surfboard are still visible, but the colors are less vibrant, and the video has a more static appearance.\n\nConsidering the criteria for evaluating the quality of the generated videos, Model A is better than Model B. Therefore, the final verdict is:\n\n1. Model A is better: [[A>B]]\n\nThis conclusion is based on the observation that Model A's generated video is more visually appealing and esthetically pleasing, with a more natural look and better dynamic quality compared to Model B.", "model_vote": "[[A>B]]", "human_vote": "bothbad_vote", "correct": false}
